## Setup

### Desktop

To get started with desktop, click the "star" icon(â˜…) at the top right of the screen, it should be part of the URL Bar. After clicking the icon, you should see an option called "Name". Change this to the name of the bookmarklet. Below that, you should see a "Folder" option, put it in whatever folder you desire. Below both of those options is a button labled "More...". Click that button, a popup should appear. Click the "URL" section, and replace the URL with the code for the bookmarklet code. To replace the URL, there are two methods: Method one is to manually select the URL, then paste the code, method two is to use CTRL/CMD + A to select the URL, and then pasting the bookmarklet code.
